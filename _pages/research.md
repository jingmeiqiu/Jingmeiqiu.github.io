My research interests include high order structure-preserving numerical methods for fluid, kinetic and multi-scale models. Specific topics include: 

- Low rank high order tensor approach for multi-scale kinetic simulations with local conservation and structure preservation. 
- Eulerian-Lagrangian high order Runge-Kutta discontinous Galerkin methods.
- High order semi-Lagrangian method for kinetic and transport equations with applications in astrophysics, plasma Physics and meteorology.
- High order methods for temporal multi-scale problems: implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method and integral deferred correction method for singular perturbation problems.
