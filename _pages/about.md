I am a Professor at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). My general area of research is scientific computing and applied mathematics.

My research interests include high order structure-preserving numerical methods for fluid, kinetic and multi-scale models. Recently I am interested in Eulerian-Lagrangian high order Runge-Kutta discontinous Galerkin methods and low rank approximations to high dimensional nonlinear dynamics.
