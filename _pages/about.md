I am a Professor at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/) and an affiliated faculty member in [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). My general area of research is Numerical analysis and Scientific Computing. 

My recent research interests lie in the design, analysis and application of high order structure preserving computational algorithms, for complex systems that involve multi-scale and multi-physics features and are of high dimensional nature. The methodologies that our group recently work on include the low rank tensor approximation to high dimensional problems with structure preservation, and Eulerian-Lagrangian high order numerical methods for fluid and kinetic applications.
